The LaTeX class drexel-thesis is distributed in the docstrip file
  drexel-thesis.dtx
with the install file
  drexel-thesis.ins
For more information on the docstrip format, see
  http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/info/dtxtut/
  http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/base/

To generate the class file drexel-thesis.cls, the template files, the
pdf documentation, and a bunch of intermediate files, run
  make
in this directory.  You'll need to install drexel-thesis.cls somewhere
in your texmf tree (or just dump it into the top level of your thesis
directory).  Running
  make temp-clean
will get rid of the intermediate files.

We also package the LyX template `drexel-thesis.layout` to assist
those using the drexel-thesis template with LyX.

Happy TeXing!
